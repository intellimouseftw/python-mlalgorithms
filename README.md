# Python Machine Learning Algorithms


Introduction
------------
This is a personal project to create rigorous codes that run machine learning algorithms on 
Python3, coded solely using numpy and pandas.

Current progress of project:
- Supports linear regression, logistic regression
- Supports kfold validation
- Supports regularization tuning

Usage
-----
Code is applicable to different data sets, data sets will have to be manually imported and
manipulated by the user.

Model accuracy is computed after the model parameters are obtained. K-fold validation is used
to increase reliability of computed accuracy.

Cross-validation data can be used for model accuracy comparisons against different hyper-
parameters. An example would be to tune the regularization parameter lambda.


End-Notes
---------
The regression functions similarly to using sklearn regression functions.


Future Plans
------------
- Rigorous code for neural network (successfully coded on MATLAB, pending conversion to Python3)
